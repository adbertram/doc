  title: Windows Local Account
  description: The Windows Local Account {{ en.ANYID }} ***provider*** allows you to manage local Windows account on many hosts.
---

This ***provider*** allows you to manage local Windows accounts on many hosts. The Windows Account ***provider*** already exists within {{ en.DVLS }}, but that ***provider*** only allows you to manage one host. This {{ en.ANYID }} ***provider*** will allow you to manage many hosts, all managed by the same ***provider***.

You can find the pre-built template for this {{ en.ANYID }} ***provider*** [here](https://github.com/Devolutions/PAM-Providers/tree/master/Providers/Windows%20Accounts).
