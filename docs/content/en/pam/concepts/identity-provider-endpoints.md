    Identity provider endpoints are the interfaces to which a provider connects to an identity provider.
---

An ***identity provider endpoint*** is the interface to which a ***provider*** connects to an ***identity provider***. ***Identity provider endpoints*** are baked into {{ en.DVPAM }} for ***managed providers*** but are required when building ***action scripts*** for {{ en.ANYID }} ***providers***.

***Identity provider endpoints*** are what a ***provider*** connects to on an ***identity provider*** to authenticate itself. An ***identity provider endpoint*** can be anything from a DNS hostname for an Active Directory domain controller, an IP address to a Linux operating system or an HTTP URL for a [REST API endpoint](https://blog.postman.com/what-is-an-api-endpoint/).
