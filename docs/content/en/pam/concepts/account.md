An ***account*** is an identity that a {{ en.DVPAM }} provider manages.

***Accounts*** are stored on external ***identity providers***. Think of an account as an identity assigned to a person or service like a user account with a username and password, a certificate, a [Microsoft Azure AD application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals?tabs=browser), etc.

An account could be a user account in Microsoft Active Directory for Bob Smith in HR or a certificate attached to a web server encrypting web traffic. It establishes an identity that ties both authorization and access level to a person or service.
