A ***template*** is an {{ en.ANYID }}-specific set of instructions that {{ en.DVPAM }} uses to build an {{ en.ANYID }} ***provider*** or ***propagation***. ***Templates*** are manifests of instructions. They contain information such as ***actions***, ***action properties*** and embedded ***action scripts*** {{ en.DVPAM }} understands to build {{ en.ANYID }} ***providers*** or ***propagation***.

***Templates*** are built within {{ en.DVLS }} following ***identity provider***-specific configurations such as creating placeholders for ***identity provider endpoints***, specific ports to connect to an ***identity provider*** and other miscellaneous ***action properties***.
