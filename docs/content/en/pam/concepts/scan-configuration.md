A ***scan configuration*** is a task within {{ en.DVPAM }} that discovers new and updated ***accounts*** for a ***provider*** that carries out an ***account discovery action***. ***Scan configurations*** are responsible for executing ***account discovery action scripts*** (for {{ en.ANYID }} providers) or internal ***account discovery actions*** for builtin ***providers***.

They return a set of ***accounts*** that can be then imported into {{ en.DVPAM }} for full management.
